- Fixed an issue where loading multiple demo samples simultaneously could cause load failures.
- Fixed a bug where dragging a single node on the schema graph caused it to snap back to its original position.
- Fixed a bug in the schema graph where, after dragging, hovering over a node or edge showed the overlay popup at the mouseâ€™s previous position instead of the current one.

- The number of rows for the job is now a column on the jobs page.

### Fixed
- Fixed answer graph visualization to distinguish nodes by both frame type and key value to prevent incorrect merges across node types with overlapping keys.
- Fixed CSV inference failure caused by unnormalized Windows line endings by standardizing line breaks before parsing.
- Fixed a bug where the answer graph visualization could hang when the same label was used multiple times or when properties were aliased.


## 2.2.1 (4/9/2025)

### Changed
- Answer graph and dynamic visualization now stay on and update when the page or rows per page is updated in the results table.
